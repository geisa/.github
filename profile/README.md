The Grid Edge Interoperability and Security Alliance (GEISA) provides a specification which defines a consistent, secure, and interoperable computing environment for embedded devices at the very edge of the electric utility grid, like electric meters and distribution automation devices, for the benefit of utilities, platform vendors, and software vendors. GEISA is a project under the [LF Energy](https://lfenergy.org/).

The [GEISA project page](https://lfenergy.org/projects/geisa/) has general details about the GEISA effort.  The [GEISA Wiki](https://lf-energy.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GEISA/overview) has notes from GEISA meetings.  

Want to get involved?  Check out the [onboarding page](https://lf-energy.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GEISA/pages/66617382/Onboarding+New+Members) for details about our meetings.

The [GEISA specification](https://github.com/geisa/specification) is developed under the [Community Specification License](https://github.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification).  All other GEISA artifacts are under the [Apache License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).

The GEISA Github site has multiple repositories.  Broadly, these respositories include the specification itself, [protobuf](https://protobuf.dev/) definitions for transaction defined in the specification, a conformance test, and respositories for mock-ups and technology experiments. 

Key repositories are:
* [Specification](https://github.com/geisa/specification)
* [Conformance](https://github.com/geisa/specification)
* [Schemas](https://github.com/geisa/schemas)
